<summary> Using RISC-V complier </summary>

``` riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -march=rv64i -mabi=lp64 -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c ``` command was used to compile using riscv compiler.
Initially it threw an error

<summary> View the disassembled ALP code </summary>

```riscv64-unkonwn-elf-objdump sum1ton.o```

While viewing the alp code, we need to look at the main section, to do so, we search ```\main``` till the correct section is found, use ```n``` to go further down to other "main". 

Here, since we used -O1 optimisation, the number of instructions are 15.

When we use -Ofast optimisation, we can see that the number of instructions have been reduced to 12.

<summary> Unsigned Numbers </summary>
Unsigned numbers, also known as non-negative numbers, are numerical values that represent magnitudes without indicating direction or sign.
Range: 0 to 2^(N) - 1.

<details>
<summary> Signed Numbers </summary>
Signed numbers are numerical values that can represent both positive and negative magnitudes, along with zero.
Range : -(2^(N-1)) to 2^(N-1) - 1.

64 bit Number System For Unsigned Numbers
* RISC-V doubleword can represent 0 to (2^(64) - 1) unsigned numbers or positive numbers
* RISC-V doubleword can represent 0 to (2^(63) - 1)positive & (-1) to (-2^63) negative numbers

# DAY 2

<details> 
<summary> Application Binary Interface (ABI) Overview </summary>

An Application Binary Interface (ABI) constitutes a set of regulations that oversee the arrangement and access of functions, data structures, and system calls within a binary program or library. This framework establishes the fundamental interaction between distinct components of a program or between a program and the operating system. Noteworthy aspects of an ABI encompass:

1. Binary Harmony: ABIs ensure that binary code generated by one compiler or platform can harmonize seamlessly with code produced by another, provided they adhere to the same ABI specifications.

2. Function Calling Protocol: ABIs dictate the protocol for invoking functions, encompassing the sequence and location of arguments and return values, as well as the management of the call stack during function invocations.

3. Register Utilization: ABIs specify which registers are earmarked for specific purposes (e.g., argument passing, return values, temporary storage) and the manner in which they are managed during function calls.

4. Data Arrangement: ABIs outline the arrangement of data structures, such as structs and arrays, in memory, including guidelines for alignment and padding.

5. Exception Handling: They delineate the treatment of exceptions (e.g., hardware or software interrupts), encompassing the transition of control between user code and exception handlers.

6. System Calls: ABIs detail the manner in which programs interact with the operating system via system calls, including the mechanism for passing arguments and retrieving results.

7. Platform Neutrality: ABIs foster compatibility across distinct platforms (e.g., diverse CPU architectures or operating systems) by offering a standardized interface.

8. Dynamic Linking: They address dynamic linking aspects, including the loading and linking of shared libraries (DLLs on Windows or shared objects on Unix-based systems) during runtime.

9. Versioning: Certain ABIs incorporate mechanisms for versioning, enabling future modifications without disrupting compatibility with existing code.

10. Documentation: ABIs are typically documented and published, facilitating developers in crafting code that adheres to the ABI's specifications.

11. Toolchain Support: Compilers and assemblers are designed to produce code in accordance with the ABI, ensuring interoperability among code generated by varied tools.

12. Cross-Platform Development: ABIs hold special significance in cross-platform development, where code must execute on multiple platforms with potentially distinct hardware architectures and operating systems.

13. Security: ABIs may encompass security-related elements, such as safeguards against buffer overflows and stack vulnerabilities.

<summmary> Memory Allocation for Multi-Byte Values </summmary>

Storing a 64-bit number (or any multi-byte value) in memory necessitates awareness of byte order, leading to proper byte arrangement.

Little-Endian: In little-endian format, the least significant byte (LSB) is stored at the lowest memory address, while the most significant byte (MSB) is positioned at the highest memory address.

Big-Endian: Conversely, big-endian format places the most significant byte (MSB) at the lowest memory address, while the least significant byte (LSB) is located at the highest memory address.

<details> 
<summary> Load, Add, and Store Instructions </summary>

Fundamental operations within computer architecture and assembly programming encompass Load, Add, and Store instructions, serving to manipulate data in memory and registers.

Illustrative Example: ``` ld x8, 16(x23) ```
In this instance:

* ``` ld ``` signifies the load double-word instruction.
* ``` x8 ``` denotes the destination register.
* ``` 16(x23) ``` designates the memory address indicated by register x23 (base address + offset).

![image](https://github.com/shreyakotagal/pes_asic_class/assets/117657204/218b78bb-b5bb-466f-bfca-4ba81e277af8)

Illustrative Example: ``` add x8, x24, x8 ```

![image](https://github.com/shreyakotagal/pes_asic_class/assets/117657204/0eb9fcc4-8f33-4f93-8d6a-7e9f472c2bd4)


Here:

``` add ``` signifies the add instruction.
``` x8 ``` represents the destination register.
``` x24 ``` and ``` x8 ``` are source registers.

<summary> 32 Registers and Associated ABI Names </summary>

The decision regarding the quantity of registers within a processor's architecture, such as the RISC-V RV64 configuration with its 32 general-purpose registers, involves a compromise between several factors. While contemporary processors might feature more registers, augmenting their number could result in larger instructions, consuming additional memory and potentially impeding instruction fetch and decoding.
